# Task 1: Data Science Careers


I’m very interested in the financial industry, my ideal job would combine working with data to predict the future of the stock market (or something like that). The reason that I’m interested in these positions is that they involve both my passion for computer science, data science, and finance. I believe these positions would be a great introduction to the industry and would help me land my dream in the future.
