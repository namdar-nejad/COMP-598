I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this question out and I believe there are some problems with the data collection that we didn't consider before annotation. Most importantly, the first 10000 tweets that we are working on only belong to 10 users that is not a proper representation of the demographic, moreover, it seems that the language detection is not accurate since there is a "LANGUAGE UNDEFINED" which is tagged for some tweets that are clearly in English, furthermore are counting several tweets with the identical content. If we want to have good data analysis we first need to address the problems above and much more and make sure the collected data is accurate.
